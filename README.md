Customizable, printable check-off grocery list

## What
A grocery list, made from a spreadsheet, that prints on a single page.

<img src="./list_snapshot.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">

## Why
- Solves the problem of looking in the pantry to see what's *not* there
- Pen and paper > another app
- Customize based on what you buy and how the store is organized

## How
- Print on the back of already-printed-on paper
- Color in the squares adjacent to the items you need
- Cross off as you go, circle items you didn't get and still need
- After shopping, copy over any outstanding items to the next list
- Meal ideas go in the whitespace at the bottom

### Why GitHub
In case people aren't comfortable opening an Excel file from the internet, this makes it more transparent who it was edited by and when.
